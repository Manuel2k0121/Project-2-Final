# Project-2-Rough-Draft
I will be using multiple seqeunce alignment to compare the BRCA1 gene of three different animal species. I will show these results using sequence logo. Then I will find the level expression of this gene in all three species after this gene has been mutated. I will do this using RNA Seq and show the results through a heatmpa. My scientific question is as follows: BRCA1 gene is a tumor suppresor gene found in many species including humans, dogs, and cats. When there is a mutation in this gene, cancer is more prone to develop?
